In particular, the number of children is lower when mothers are much older than fathers. However, previous analyses failed to disentangle the influence of differential parental age per se from a direct age effect of each parent. In this study, we analyse the fitness consequences of both parental age and parental age differences on litter size and offspring survival in two closely related species of lemurs living in captivity. As captive lemurs do not choose their reproductive partner, we were able to measure litter size and offspring survival across breeding pairs showing a wide range of parental age differences. However, we demonstrated that the effect of the parental age difference on litter size was fully accounted for by female reproductive senescence because females mating with much younger males were old females. On the other hand, both parental age difference and female reproductive senescence influenced offspring survival. Our results emphasize the importance of teasing apart the effect of parental reproductive senescence when investigating the health and fitness consequences of parental age differences and also provide new insights for conservation programmes of endangered species.",2018,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,,,1886,285,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMID: 30209228,,,,Age Factors; Female; Animals; Male; *Reproduction; *ageing; *Aging; *Genetic Fitness; *litter size; *maternal effect; *offspring survival; *paternal effect; *primate; Lemuridae/genetics/*physiology,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Offspring number and size as two plastic life-history traits, are commonly used to determine the reproductive investment. In this study, we evaluated the evolutionary trade-off between clutch size and egg size in the spot-legged treefrog (Polypedates megacephalus) along an altitudinal gradient. The results showed that females did not exhibit a significant correlation between body size, clutch size and egg size within each population, apart from the Leigong population. We did not find any evidence for the trade-off between clutch size and egg size within or among populations; however, clutch size and egg size from the highest-altitude population were larger than those from the lowest-altitude populations. Our findings suggest that the larger egg size may compensate for the increased mortality rates of their offspring at high altitudes.",2017,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,58–62,,1,13,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,,age structure; altitudinal variation; amphibians.; body-size; breeding elevation; dimorphism; environmental gradient; fecundity; frog rana-sylvatica; geographic-variation; life history; life-history traits; maternal investment; parental investment; renschs rule; toad bufo-andrewsi,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Brood-rearing and renesting abilities were greater for older parents. The oldest age class of White-tailed Ptarmigan showed reproductive senescence for laying date and clutch size but fledged such a large proportion of the brood that they had the highest overall production of any class, It thus appears that parental experience can compensate for reduced physical ability to produce eggs, Annual mortality rates for breeding females were U-shaped for White-tailed Ptarmigan, with higher rates for young and old birds, but mortality did not change with age in Willow Ptarmigan, Overall, the two species differed in the presence of age dependence for only two traits (renesting ability and annual survival), Age-dependent effects were generally greater for White-tailed Ptarmigan than for Willow Ptarmigan, The patterns of mortality and fecundity we observed in ptarmigan provide general support for the constraint hypothesis of reproductive performance.

Reproductive fitness of second-generation (F2) females was tested from the age of 25 wk until the end of their reproductive life. In F2 males, the testing period ranged from the age of 52 wk until their natural death. Delayed motherhood of hybrid F1 female mice was associated with a decreased percentage of male F3 offspring at birth and lower life expectancy and body weight during adulthood of F2 offspring. There was, however, no evident negative effect of delayed motherhood on several reproductive fitness variables in either male or female F2 offspring. This included between-parturition interval, litter size at birth and at weaning, body weight at weaning and preweaning mortality of F3 pups, percentage of F3 litters with at least one pup cannibalized, and time at which female and male F2 offspring ceased their reproductive life.

Courtship involved five steps, viz. approach, watch, examine, mount and attempt, and was male dominated under laboratory conditions. Results indicate that physical cues probably play a role in the initiation of courtship, while chemical signals are probably involved in the continuation of courtship, culminating in intromission. The mating duration, latent period and number of bouts gradually decreased with increase in the number of matings; however, the interval between bouts slightly increased. Pseudo-mating with dead mates was observed in C. saucia. The oviposition period, fecundity and % egg viability were highest in females mated multiple times, while lowest in those that mated once.

Evolutionary, rich households would therefore benefit more from sons, and according to the Trivers-Willard hypothesis, parents invest more in offspring of the sex that has the best reproductive prospects. We determined the sex differences in number of offspring, sex ratio of offspring, offspring survival and offspring weight in rich and poor households in a polygynous population. METHODOLOGY: We studied a population of 28 994 individuals in Northern Ghana during an 8-year prospective follow-up. We determined the fertility rate for both men and women, sex ratio of 3511 newborn offspring and offspring survival in 16 632 offspring up to reproductive age (\textless/=18 years). Also, we collected 9842 weight measurements of 1470 offspring up to the age of 3 years from growth charts of local clinics. RESULTS: In rich households, men have a lifetime number of 6.0 offspring, while for women this was 3.1. In line with evolutionary predictions, the male:female sex ratio was higher in rich households (0.52; poor households 0.49), sons had lower mortality in rich households (hazard ratio male versus female 1.06, P = 0.64; poor households: hazard ratio male versus female 1.46, P = 0.01) and sons also had higher weights in rich households (P = 0.008). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: In rich households, men have higher reproductive prospects in this polygynous society and, in line with Trivers-Willard, we registered more sons in rich households, sons had lower mortality and higher weights, maximizing the reproductive output in this society.",2013,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,37–45,,1,2013,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMID: 24481185,,,,reproduction; Africa; offspring survival; offspring weight; sex differences; Trivers-Willard,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Differences in the physiological characteristics were compared with each other among the progeny produced from parents of different ages. The daily oviposition rate and the hatchability and size of eggs laid, on 1st to 2nd, 6th to 7th, 11th to 12th, 13th to 14th and later than 15th days elapsed after the beginning of oviposition, increased at first, attaining their maxima on 6-7th or 11-12th days and then decreased with increasing maternal age, forming parabolic trends. Daily changes in the number of eggs laid by each female, however, showed a cyclic fluctuation at intervals of 3-4 days over her oviposition period. In each cycle, most of the eggs were laid on the first day, and the later the day in the cycle the fewer were the eggs deposited. The same cyclic trends were also detected in the daily hatchability and size of eggs laid over the whole oviposition period. It was considered, therefore, that female physiological activity gradually decreases after passing the postemergence maturatoin period so that the trend will become parabolic and that the nuequal partitioning of maternal food reserves will cause a change for the worse in the viability of the progeny produced during the last half of individual ovipositional cycles. The incubation period of eggs and most characteristics in the larval period, the size of the hatchling, survival time of unfed hatchling, length of period from oviposition to adult emergence, survival at larval stage etc monotonously changed with the aging of mothers. This gap, between the parabolic trends observed at the egg stage and the monotonous changes at the later stage, may be accounted for by the possibility of many deaths of weak progeny that result from selective elimination which could be associated with the unequal partitioning of the egg substrate, and also from the posponed manifestation of age related qualitative difference of the progeny itself. The difference of parental age gave rise to the qualitative variability of the adult progeny. Young mothers brought forth their progeny with protracted preoviposition period, low fecundity and long life-span. On the other hand remarkably persevering adults which withstood starvation longer came into being from old mothers. It is suggested that both adult progenies will assume different functions in the life of this species. ©1970, JAPANESE SOCIETY OF APPLIED ENTOMOLOGY AND ZOOLOGY.

Patterns of clutch size and hatching asynchrony were analysed in the Eurasian kestrel [Falco tinnunculus (Linnaeus)] breeding in Finland, where small mammal populations show dramatic 3-year cycles. Data collected over 12 years showed that clutches were larger when food was more abundant in spring. While controlling for clutch size, hatching was more synchronous in the low phase of the vole cycle compared to the increase phase, contrary to conventional interpretation of the brood reduction hypothesis. The age of the female, but not the age of the male was associated with the degree of asynchrony. Paradoxically, numbers of voles were most stable in the 'low' phase, which may lead to a unique situation, where food is more predictable when scarce. Kestrels have small, synchronous clutches in the 'low' phase and large asynchronous clutches in the 'increase' phase. Based on results of this study, it is suggested that it is important to consider the predictability of food, and not only the mean abundance of food when evaluating hypotheses for hatching asynchrony. Patterns of clutch size and hatching asynchrony at the population level can be used to evaluate current energy-related hypotheses for asynchrony.",1998,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,908–917,,6,67,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,PMID: 26412370,,,,Falco tinnunculus; energetic constraint; food supply; hatching asynchrony; incubation; vole cycle,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

High Warao general mortality rates were mentioned in a limited study 21 years ago. However, there have been no comprehensive studies addressing child survival across the entire population. OBJECTIVES: To determine the Child Survival-Index (CSI) (ratio: still-living children/total-live births) in the Warao population, the principal causes of childhood death and the socio-demographic factors associated with childhood deaths. METHODS: We conducted a cross-sectional epidemiological survey of 688 women from 97 communities in 7 different subregions of the Orinoco Delta. Data collected included socio-demographic characteristics and the reproductive history of each woman surveyed. The multidimensional poverty index (MPI) was used to classify the households as deprived across the three dimensions of the Human Development Index. Multivariable linear regression and Generalized Linear Model Procedures were used to identify socioeconomic and environmental characteristics statistically associated with the CSI. FINDINGS: The average CSI was 73.8% +/-26. The two most common causes of death were gastroenteritis/diarrhea (63%) and acute respiratory tract Infection/pneumonia (18%). Deaths in children under five years accounted for 97.3% of childhood deaths, with 54% occurring in the neonatal period or first year of life. Most of the women (95.5%) were classified as multidimensionally poor. The general MPI in the sample was 0.56. CSI was negatively correlated with MPI, maternal age, residence in a traditional dwelling and profession of the head of household other than nurse or teacher. CONCLUSIONS: The Warao have a low CSI which is correlated with MPI and maternal age. Infectious diseases are responsible for 85% of childhood deaths.

Identifying traits that affect reproductive success is essential to achieve this goal. Longitudinal reproductive events of the captive population of endangered red wolves (Canis rufus Audubon and Bachman, 1851) were investigated to determine whether parental age, breeding experience, and rearing type were factors in reproduction, litter size, and sex ratio, as well as viability of offspring. Younger wolves were more likely to reproduce and produce larger litters than were older individuals. The age of the female, but not the male, had a negative effect on pup survival. Wolves that had prior experience in offspring production were more likely to reproduce again than were individuals that had no prior reproductive success, but prior sexual experience alone was not a factor in offspring production. Parental breeding experience had a negative effect on pup survival, but no apparent relationships with litter size or sex ratio. Declines in reproduction, fitness, and survival with advancing age suggest the effect is due to senescence, the onset of which occurs at 8 years of age in females. The results are consistent with the breeding-experience hypothesis.",2014,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,251–258,,3,92,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,Reproduction; Senescence; Age hypothesis; Breeding-experience hypothesis; Canis rufus; Red wolf; Reproductive experience,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The probability of weaning a litter did not vary with female age, body condition, time of emergence, or previous reproduction. Litter size, litter mass, and offspring survival did not vary with age, whereas individual offspring mass was lower in yearlings than in older females. Body condition upon emergence had no effect on litter size, litter mass, offspring mass, and survival. Reproduction did not influence female survival, physical condition upon emergence next spring, or subsequent reproductive efforts. The only factor that affected the extent of reproductive effort and offspring survival was the date of emergence: the later a female emerged, the lower the total and mean offspring mass, and fewer offspring survived. The modulation of reproduction in female S. fulvus by only the timing of vernal emergence and independent of other individual characteristics can be explained by the high costs of missed reproductive opportunity because of short longevity combined with low costs of reproduction when resources are abundant enough to meet both somatic and reproductive needs.",2014,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,737–747,,8,92,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,,survival; life-history; trade-offs; body-weight; age; costs; hibernation; individual-differences; litter size; overwinter survival; reproductive costs; reproductive decisions; sexual differences; spermophilus fulvus; timing of reproduction; yellow ground squirrel,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

Based on 50% mating incidence the calculated age of sexual maturation of males and females was 10.5 and 11.1 days, respectively, which was not statistically significant. However, on the basis of age at first mating, that is, sexual maturity, females matured 2 days earlier than males. Fecundity, pre-oviposition, oviposition and post-oviposition period and female longevity appear to be influenced by female age at mating with reproductive performance peaking at 30 days. On the other hand, egg viability was influenced by male age and was highest when males mated at the age of 40 days. To summarise, egg production and timing of egg deposition was female age-dependent, whereas egg fertility was male age-dependent. It was also observed that females mated at a later age and laid a higher number of eggs immediately after mating than did earlier mated females. This was ostensibly in a bid to increase fitness by maximizing reproductive output in the reduced life span available. This is the first investigation on the effect of age of females at mating on reproduction in this beetle.",2010,14/02/2020 12:50,14/02/2020 12:50,,112–120,,2,17,,,,,,,,,,English,,,,,,,,,,,egg viability; evolution; maternal age; paternal age; senescence; aphidophagous ladybird; butterflies; females; host deprivation; hysterophorus; lifetime fecundity; longevity; propylea-dissecta; zygogramma bicolorata,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
